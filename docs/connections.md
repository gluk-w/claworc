# Connections (Composio)

> Part of the [Internal Proxy](./internal-proxy.md). Connections are served on the
> `/connections/` route of the shared `internal/internalproxy` server, alongside
> the [LLM gateway](./virtual-keys.md).

## Overview

**Connections** let an OpenClaw agent use OAuth-backed third-party services
(Gmail, Google Analytics, and anything else [Composio](https://composio.dev)
supports) **without the agent ever holding any credential**.

- The control plane holds a single, global **Composio API key** (encrypted,
  configured in Settings → API Keys).
- The OAuth connect flow runs entirely on the control plane.
- The agent reaches Composio only through the `/connections/` broker on the
  internal proxy, authenticated by a per-instance `CLAWORC_CONNECTION_SECRET`.
  The broker injects the real Composio API key and a server-derived `user_id`.

No OAuth tokens are stored on the control plane — Composio holds them, keyed by a
stable per-instance `user_id`.

## Concepts

| Composio term | Meaning here |
|---------------|--------------|
| **Toolkit** | A connectable service (Gmail, Google Analytics, …). Listed via `GET /toolkits?managed_by=composio`. |
| **Auth config** | Per-toolkit OAuth blueprint using Composio-managed auth. One is created+cached per toolkit (`composio_auth_configs` table). |
| **Connected account** | A user's authorized link to a toolkit. One Composio `user_id` per Claworc instance: `claworc-inst-<instance UUID>`. |

A connection row (`composio_connections` table) records `instance_id`,
`toolkit_slug`, `name`, the opaque Composio connected-account id, `status`
(`INITIATED` → `ACTIVE`/`FAILED`/`EXPIRED`), and an account label for display.

## Connect flow

```
UI (Add connection wizard)            Control plane                 Composio
  pick toolkit ───────────────────►  POST /instances/{id}/connections
                                       ensure CLAWORC_CONNECTION_SECRET
                                       ensure auth_config (cached) ──► POST /auth_configs
                                       link(user_id, auth_config) ──► POST /connected_accounts/link
                                     ◄── { connected_account_id, redirect_url }   (NO db row yet)
  window.open(redirect_url) ──────────────────────────────────────► hosted OAuth consent
  user authorizes ◄───────────────── redirect to /connections/callback (our origin)
  callback postMessage → wizard
  confirm ─────────────────────────►  POST /instances/{id}/connections/confirm
                                       check status ──────────────► GET /connected_accounts/{id}
                                       if ACTIVE → persist row
                                     ◄── { status: ACTIVE, connection }
  list refreshes, wizard closes
```

A pending connection lives **only in the browser's memory** until it is
confirmed `ACTIVE` — `POST /connections` never writes a row, so an abandoned flow
leaves nothing behind. The OAuth callback is handled **entirely in the browser**:
`callback_url` is a client-side SPA route (`/connections/callback`) on our own
origin that `postMessage`s the opener and closes. On that message the wizard
calls `confirm`, which checks the status with Composio and persists the row only
if `ACTIVE`. The popup closing is a fallback trigger for the same confirm step.

## CLAWORC_CONNECTION_SECRET

A per-instance secret (`claworc-cs-<48 hex>`) authenticates the agent to the
`/connections/` broker.

- Generated for **every instance** and re-ensured on every container/pod
  (re)create, so the env var is always present (`injectConnectionSecret` in
  `internal/handlers/instances.go`, reserved name in `internal/handlers/envvars.go`).
- Stored Fernet-encrypted on the instance row (`connection_secret`), with an
  indexed SHA-256 hash (`connection_secret_hash`) so the broker resolves the
  owning instance in O(1) without decrypting rows.
- Injected as the reserved `CLAWORC_CONNECTION_SECRET` env var.

## Proxy contract (agent side)

The broker exposes a narrow allowlist — everything else is rejected. The agent
(e.g. via a user-authored OpenClaw skill) calls:

```bash
# Discover the tools available for this instance's connected toolkits
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:40001/connections/tools \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLAWORC_CONNECTION_SECRET"

# Execute a tool
curl -s -X POST http://127.0.0.1:40001/connections/tools/execute/GMAIL_SEND_EMAIL \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CLAWORC_CONNECTION_SECRET" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"arguments":{"recipient_email":"x@y.z","subject":"Hi","body":"…"}}'
```

The broker injects the real `x-api-key` and forces `user_id` to the instance's
derived value — any client-supplied `user_id`/`connected_account_id` is stripped.
`GET /tools` is scoped to the instance's `ACTIVE` toolkits; with no connections it
returns an empty list rather than the full catalog.

> OpenClaw does not have a generic HTTP-tool config, so wiring the agent to these
> endpoints (e.g. a skill per connection) is left to the user — the control plane
> only brokers the HTTP and injects the secret.

## Lifecycle

- **Instance restart** — the secret is re-injected from the DB; connections
  survive because Composio holds the tokens keyed by the stable UUID-derived
  `user_id`.
- **Connection delete** — best-effort delete of the Composio connected account,
  then the local row is removed.
- **Instance delete** — best-effort delete of every connected account, then the
  connection rows are removed; the secret dies with the instance row.

## API endpoints (control plane)

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `GET` | `/api/v1/connections/toolkits` | List connectable OAuth toolkits |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/instances/{id}/connections` | List an instance's connections |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/instances/{id}/connections` | Initiate a connection (no row) → `redirect_url` |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/instances/{id}/connections/confirm` | Confirm ACTIVE with Composio; persist on success |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/instances/{id}/connections/{connId}` | Remove a connection |
